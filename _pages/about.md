Hi There! I'm Helin Cao (in Chinese: 曹贺淋). You can also call me Henry.

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Center for Robotics at the University of Bonn](https://www.robotics.uni-bonn.de/) and the [Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://lamarr-institute.org/), with [Prof. Sven Behnke](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/) of [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/). I am lucky to be a part of Team [NimbRo@Home](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/@Home/), which participated in multiple international competitions.

Before that, I spent three wonderful years during my master program at Technical University of Munich, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) and [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/steinbach-eckehard) during my master thesis at [Visual Computing Group](https://niessnerlab.org/index.html).

My research interests lie in the perception and understanding of 3D environments for robotics. Specifically, I am interested in:

- Representation Learning on Semantic Scene Completion;
- Generative model for 3D Scene;
- Embodied Artificial Intelligence.

I am incredibly thankful to my collaborators and mentors, and enjoy exploring new domains through collaborations. If you have questions or would like to work together, feel free to reach out through email!
