Hi There! I'm Helin Cao (in Chinese: 曹贺淋). You can also call me Henry.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Center for Robotics at the University of Bonn](https://www.robotics.uni-bonn.de/) and the [Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://lamarr-institute.org/), with [Prof. Sven Behnke](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/) of [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/).

Before that, I spent three wonderful years during my master program at Technical University of Munich, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) and [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/steinbach-eckehard) during my master thesis at [Visual Computing Group](https://niessnerlab.org/index.html). Prior to this, I got my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://studyatnuaa.org/).

My research interests lie in the perception and understanding of 3D environments for robotics. Specifically, I am interested in:

- Representation Learning for Scene Completion;
- Categorical & Instance & Open-world semantics representation for the 3D environment;
- Perception for robot manipulation and navigation.

I am incredibly thankful to my collaborators and mentors, and enjoy exploring new domains through collaborations. If you have questions or would like to work together, feel free to reach out through email!
